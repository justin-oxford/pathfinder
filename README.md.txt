# pathfinder
Repo for pathfinder algorithm tests SOURCE CODE

(for the standalone application see [https://github.com/justin-oxford/pathfinder-app])
This app has only been tested on Windows 10.

This is a simple C++/SFML application which features a grid to demonstrate A-Star and Dijkstra's algorithms.

UI is crude, but the purpose of this project is to demonstrate the algorithms, not SFML UI abilities. This is something I may revisit.
